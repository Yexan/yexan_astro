import Codepen from '../../components/Codepen.astro';

Once more I tried to challenge myself in a CSS only POC. I tried to reproduce a phone with as little DOM element as possible.

Then I've added an enter animation for fun :)

<Codepen
  slug="JrPKyb"
  title="CSS only - Animated phone"
  height="600"
  render="html,result"
></Codepen>

### Interesting points I've practiced on this POC :

- As usual SASS syntax as it's really clean and concise
- It was fun to play with the shapes and create the sensors and phone bottom :)
