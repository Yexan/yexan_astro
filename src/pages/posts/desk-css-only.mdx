import Codepen from '../../components/Codepen.astro';


I tried to challenge myself in a CSS only POC. I tried to reproduce a desk with a computer and a cup of tea / coffee with as little DOM element as possible.


<Codepen slug="pjmOEq" title="Desk CSS Only" height="800"></Codepen>


### Interesting points I've practiced on this POC :
  + As usual SASS syntax as it's really clean and concise
  + It was fun to play with the `box-shadow` to create the paper block and the keyboard :D
