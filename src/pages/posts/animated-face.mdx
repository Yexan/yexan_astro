import Codepen from '../../components/Codepen.astro';

This is an october 2015 project :)

At one point in my dev journey I tried to consolidate my CSS understanding and skill by challenging myself to reproduce visual elements in CSS only.

Back then we couldn't do what we can now in term of CSS features and optimization but I keept the project as it was in 2015 without modifying it to see what was possible back then

I hope you'll enjoy it. :)

<Codepen slug="PPeyWr" title="Animated Face" height="600" render="html,result"></Codepen>

### Interesting points I've practiced on this POC :

- It was fun as it was the begining when I got into creating small illustrations in CSS only
