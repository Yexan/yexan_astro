import Codepen from '../../components/Codepen.astro';

This is small CSS only animation aiming to represent a cozy night near a lake with a tree and a sky with slightly moving stars and moon.

This is an old pen, I forced myself not to modify it with what I know now to keep it authentic with the begining of my CSS learning journey (it was in october 2015)

I hope you'll enjoy it. :)

<Codepen slug="eprZLV" title="Catch me the moon" height="600" render="html,result"></Codepen>

### Interesting points I've practiced on this POC :

- It was fun as it was the begining when I got into creating small illustrations in CSS only
