import Codepen from '../../components/Codepen.astro';

This is an october 2015 project :)

At one point in my dev journey I tried to consolidate my CSS understanding and skill by challenging myself to reproduce visual elements in CSS only.

I hope you'll enjoy it. :)

<Codepen
  slug="avYYXv"
  title="Night desert and pyramids"
  height="600"
  render="html,result"
></Codepen>

### Interesting points I've practiced on this POC :

- It was fun as it was the begining when I got into creating small illustrations in CSS only
